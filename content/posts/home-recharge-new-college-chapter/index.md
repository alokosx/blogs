## Unexpected Journey Home

Life has a way of throwing delightful surprises our way, sometimes in the form of unplanned journeys. I recently found myself embarking on one such unplanned trip home. Initially, I wasn't sure about going, but eventually, I was convinced by my mom and dad's insistence, as after this, I might not get another chance to visit until the semester winds down in May.

## Family Time and Memories

Setting off on the night of 28th Jan, my journey was more of a whirlwind than a simple homecoming. I spent the first two days with my parents, enjoying the comfort of being at home. Then, on 31st, I visited my cousin's place, and then by 2nd of February, I was at my grandparent's place, where I spent 2 days with my grandparents. The next morning on the 4th of February, I returned to my parents, wrapping up this tour before heading back to Bilaspur today.

This journey, though hectic, was filled with joy, especially with my little nieces and nephew. Their excitement and time spent with them added a layer of happiness that I'll cherish.

## A New Chapter in College

Back to my college life, the 4th semester is on the horizon. This time, I've chosen a vocational course offered by my own department, which means I'll be spending more time in my main department, eliminating the need to crisscross the campus for different classes. This change is a relief, considering the chaotic sprint from building to building, especially during spring - a time that often left me with headaches. However, I anticipate missing the variety and movement, as they kept things dynamic. Stationary days might bring a touch of monotony, but I'm ready for this new chapter.

## Coding Journey

This week was a pause because of all the travelling and all, but now that I'm back, I'm looking forward to diving back into it. Exploring new concepts will add some refreshment and an escape from my daily routine.

**Looking forward to what lies ahead and eager to embrace the challenges and joys of this new chapter. Until next time!**
