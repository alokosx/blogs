Well, hello there,
I am **Alok Patel**, an undergrad currently pursuing my Bachelors.
Well I decided to start this blog page for a few things:
 - To share my code journey. 
 - To  my content writing skills.
 - For my daily life musings.

Right now i can think only of these things..

## My Coding journey
As of now, I am learning [React.js](https://react.dev) along with fiddling around with cli tools and [Neovim](https://neovim.io) as my IDE.
You can see some of my works [here](https://alok.html-5.net/projects). I'll share my experience with Neovim in a seperate blog.
## Daily Life Update 
As I am writing this,my 3rd semester exams have just ended. I'm eager to make the most of the time I have now and be consistent with my blogging, keeping you updated with my progress and daily life.

I hope you enjoyed reading tohis post. I'll continue to share more in future, so stay tuned and feel free to give your thoughts or suggestions.
